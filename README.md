# ColocJam

This is a little game project, named "The cat who saved the world".

We wanted (as flatmates attending courses on video game programing) to do our own little game jam, in order to improve our coding skills in C# and our knowledge of video game making (especially through Unity).
So we booked our week-end, and we got a theme from https://cjanssen.bitbucket.io/themegen/, being "Strange controls".

And here we are, in about 24h we made a little game where you have to type in a sequence of symbols from your keyboard in order to save the world in several situations (the last commits are later than that, but we did 99% of the work within this time limit).

The sequences are random and the difficulty (time limit and number of symbols) is increasing through the game, but we made only 5 situations, so the context might become redundant quite rapidly. But hey, it has been made in 24h !
